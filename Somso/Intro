In order for this game to fit the theme "You Are The Villain", please just picture yourself (the red sphere) as a very bad person, whereas your enemies (the blue circles) are the heroes that represent the goodness, the good and the great, otherwise nothing will really make you feel like a "villain" more than any other game.
